    <div class="singpgimg"><img src="Images/pfpimg.jpg"></div>

    <p>My name is Aadhav Sivakumar and I'm currently 17 years old and a senior at Dublin High School.
        I live in Dublin, CA with my mom, dad, and my sister who is currently in college. Since elementary school, I've been interested
        in the field of engineering, specifically in robotics and software engineering. I participated in FLL (First Lego League), in which
        you build robots out of lego pieces to compete against others. After that, I started doing VEX, the high school level of robotics. I've been 
        participating for four years, and I was captain of team 5327B in my junior year.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm part of my school's enineering academy, and I've taken a couple of engineering courses during high school. This includes
        Computer Science Principles, Principles of Engineering, AP Computer Science Applications, Digital Electronics. These classes taught
        me different skills from a variety of different engineering disciplines. In terms of computer science, I learned
        languages like python, java, SQL, and various other web development languages. As an aspiring engineer, I hope to put my skills to good use and
        create something that benefits everyone in the future.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0px">
        I'm cooperative, achievement-oriented, and very talkative. I work in teams well, making sure the goals of the
        team are put before my personal goals. I'm also very competitive, which drives me to try and do better than those around me.
        Through this, I learn much from my peers and elders whenever I need help with something. I've learned a lot throughout my engineering experiences
        and I'm ready to explore the world of technology around me. Thank you for reading, and please take time to explore the rest of the site.

   <!-- <div class="container"><p>My name is Aadhav Sivakumar and I am currently 16 years old and a junior at Dublin High
        School. I live in dublin CA with my mom, dad, and sister, who recently went to college. I have always been
        interested in robotics and software development ever since
        I was younger. I have participated in fll (First Lego League) competitions since 4th grade, and this is my third
        year
        year of doing high school robotics. I have already taken computer science principles and am currently taking AP
        computer science applications, which
        taught me skills and tools like python, java, SQL, and various other web development languages. As an engineer, I hope to
        create something that benefits the whole
        world. One of my most recent engineering endeavors was going to the 2017 VEX robotics world championship while
        part of vex team 5327B. I helped build and program our robot, as well as present our design process, which
        eventually won us numerous awards for overall excellence. I am looking forward to building greater things and
        broadening
        my engineering knowledge in the future.</p>

        <p>While working in projects, many of my group members tell me that I am extremely enthusiastic and passionate
            about whatever I am doing. I have participated in many hackathons and really enjoyed the environment, which
            is one of the factors that made me want to go into the engineering field. In the congressional app
            challenge, I was recommended to move onto the next level, the diamond challenge. I placed in the top 3
            projects in the diamond challenge. I also am a part of the school boys volleyball team, which taught me many
            communication skills and tools that I can apply while working on engineering projects.</p>
        <p>Over the past few years, I have gotten experience in a variety of engineering fields through various programs
            and classes. Even though I have learned so much, there is still a whole world of engineering out there to
            explore, and I hope to always have a passion for engineering. Thank you for taking your time to read about
            me, and feel free to explore the rest of my site.</p>
