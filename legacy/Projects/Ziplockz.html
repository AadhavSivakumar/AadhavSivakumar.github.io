  <p style="margin-bottom:0px">Ziplockz was my freshman year entreprenuership project that i worked on with Ethan Lee, Tyle Nguyen, and Tharun Elenchezhean. The problem we decided to take on was thievery, and specifically how it affected kids in school. Thousands of students are getting robbed every day in the United States, from small things like pencils and erasers, to more valuable items like laptops and cell phones. One current solution to this is just putting a combination lock on your backpack, but if you forget your code, your out of luck. Also, if given enough time, a thief could break through the lock and steal whatever goods are inside the bag. Our soltion, Ziplockz, fixes that problem. Ziplockz is a like any other lock for your backpack zipper, but with many added functionalities. It has a built in bluetooth transmitter that sends off a distress signal whenever the lock is messed with, alerting the user to possible tampering. Instead of a combination type lock, it can only be unlocked through your phone of a physical key. You can leave the physical key somewhere saf in your house, just in case you lose your phone or forget the digital password. It also includes fingerprint sensing to make sure that it's actually the user that's trying to access the contents of the bag.
