  <p style="margin-bottom:0px">This was a 3 week project that I worked on with Shyam Pandya, Tharun Elenchezhean, and Tyler Nguyen. The goal of the project was to simulate the launch of a bottle rocket, determine the most optimal angle to launch the rocket, and create a durable rocket to be launched at the determined angle. We started by simulating the launch with a netlogo program. We used the projectile motion equations to move the rocket across the screen, and found that the most optimal angle would be 45 degrees. The rocket was created by getting a pipe and wrapping a paper around it. Since the pvc pipe was alos the way we launched the rocket, this was optimal. We then attached a cone top and some fins to the rocket to make it more aerodynamic. We then launched the rockets at the angles we calculated before. Unfortunately, thi was a pretty windy day, so the actual optimal angle was around 35 degrees to counteract the wind. my rocket went 52 yards in the end, and the prediction simulated 100 yards, but with the flaws of wind and air resistance, this could not be achieved.
