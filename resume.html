    <p>One presentation I remember from sophomore year was about the certifications necessary to go into engineering and what to do in college to get ahead by Dan Cherrier and Natalina Bernard. They talked about the difficulties that we would all have during college, and not to get discouraged if we don't do as well in college as we did in high school, stressing the importance that getting the degree is of utmost importance. C's are not equivalent to A's because they affect your GPA, but passing and getting a degree is ore important than trying to balance all of your classes. Engineering is also generally the hardest discipline because of the amount of math and physics involved in all branches. Apart from college, they talked about the necessities of engineers in all projects big or small because a licensed person has to be on site and approve all projects.</p>
    <p>The other gest speaker was Jason Yosinski, who works at the A.I. labs in uber, mainly focusing on image detection. I heard his presentation twice, once in junior year and once in senior year. His presentation was the most technical out of all the other guest speakers that I've heard over the years, and he got into some mathematical concepts that intrigued me. Using matrices and pixel colors, he was able to create a network that determined certain patterns in images, and if enough patterns were found, it was easy to associate it with an image, like a cat or a school bus. His explanation wasn't too complicated, and he talked mostly about statistics and calculus, my two favorite branches of mathematics.</p>
    <p>My visit to Stanford and the Computer Science history museum informed me about the campus, but more importantly taught me how much I wanted to learn about the inner workings of a computer and other devices that are omnipresent in the present. Seeing the evolution of computers from basic calculators to machines capable of beating the smartest people in chess was fascinating. After the field trip, I did more research on the origin of computers, and learned things that helped me through my current class, DE, as well as my previous class, APCSA.</p>
    <p>I went to the LLNL IT job shadow. On this field trip, I learned about the facility, and all the types of jobs they do there. A lot of the work was theoretical requiring massive amounts of computing power, so we got to see their supercomputer lab. They also showed us their laser facility, and the national ignition facility, which is used to test the radioactive properties of certain materials. The IT facility was important to the basic function of the entire campus, and inside, we got to take apart computers and put the back together, learning how each part interconnected with the rest.</p>
