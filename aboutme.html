<div class="container"><p>My name is Aadhav Sivakumar and I am currently 15 years old and a sophomore at dublin high school. I live in dublin CA with my mom, dad, and sister, who recently went to college. I have always been interested in robotics and software developement ever since
                    I was younger. I participated in the fll (First Lego League) competitions since 4th grade, and this is my second year of doing high school robotics. I have already taken the computer science engineering class last year, which taught me skills like python, java, and HTML. As an engineer, I hope to create something that benefits the whole world. One of my most recent engineering endeeavors was going to the 2017 VEX robotics world championship while part of vex team 5327B. I helped build our robot and present our design process, which eventually won us an award for the best programming in our division. I am looking forward to building greater things and broadening my engineering knowledge in the future.</p>

                    <p>While working in projects, many of my group members tell me that I am extremely enthusiastic and passionate about whatever I am doing. I have participated in many hackathons and really enjoyed the environment, which is one of the factors that made me want to go into the engineering field. In the congressional app challenge, I was recommended to move onto the next level, the diamond challenge. I placed in the top 3 projects in the diamond challenge. I also am a part of the school boys valleyball team, which taught me many communication skills that I can apply while working on engineering projects.</p>
                    <p>Over the past few years, I have gotten experience in a variety of engineering fields through various programs and classes. Even though I have learned so much, there is still a whole world of engineering out there to explore, and I hope to alwways have a passion for engineering. Thank you for taking your time to read about me, and feel free to explore the rest of my site.</p>
