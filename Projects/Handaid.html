  <p style="margin-bottom:0px">This was my Junior year entreprenuership project. Hundreds of thousands of people in the US neglect going to the doctor every day due to long wait times, expensive copay, and overall inconvenience. This inconvenience can lead to several health problems in the future if not diagnosed correctly. That's where hand-aid comes in. It allows us to get things like heart rate, blood pressure, and body fat percentage so you can stay informed and take precaution as needed. It also automatically creates diet plans and exercise plans that help you based off of the diagnosis that the physical solution gives. The physical solution is an arduino with many sensors connected to it, like thermal, heartbeat, and body fat. The other part is the software solution, which uses API's and other data sets to correlate some symptoms to foods that will remedy the problem. We also have a wesite you can visit at https://hand-aid.github.io/. My individual contribuition was the website, written with HTML and css. I also worked on the 3d printing of our solution, which was a box that housed all of our hardware and had a display to show what problems there were.
