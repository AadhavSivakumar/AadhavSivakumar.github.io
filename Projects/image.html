        This was a 2 week project that I worked on with my partner Manas Taneja in march of 2017. In the beginning, we were required to take an image and modify it in a way that would help a client enhance it. We decided to choose example 3 because we wanted to show the client our amazing improvements. Our first edit was to make a border. An image without a border looks very bland, but gets better when you add something around it. We tried to implement a watermark for our client, but we were unable to do it in time. The next edit was mainkg our image contrasted. Contrast scales all of the pixels' colors as opposed to brightness, which adds 1 to all of the RGB values, resulting in some wonky pictures. The last edit I did was making of the pictures negative. Since the program has to go through each color for every pixel in an image, it took a lot of processing power. Our code took about 5 hours to run, but we were satisfied with the results afterwards.
