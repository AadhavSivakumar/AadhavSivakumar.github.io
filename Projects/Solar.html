    This was a 3 week project that I worked on with Manas Taneja, Tyler Nguyen, and Alex Miller. The goal of this project was to create a vehicle that could carry 2 solar panels or 2 hydrogen cells with only one vex motor and various vex parts. We also had to compare the two energy sources and recommend one of the sources to Tesla. Our vehicle had a simplistic design with a 5 hole c-channel base on wheels. The motor was mounted onto the side of the vehicle and connected to the front pair of wheels through sprockets, chains, and axles. In the beginning, all of the teams were having all sorts of problems with their solar panels and hydrogen cells, but since our design was so simple, we got it to run from the beginning. Unfortunately, the power sources and motor that we used proved to be defective, so we had to try many different configurations until one of them worked, once we got it to work, we got very high efficiency percentages for solar and hydrogen compared to the rest of the class.
