    <p style="margin-bottom:0px">This was a 3 week long solo project for Digital Electronics. The objective of the project was to create a working PCB (Printable Circuit Board) from scratch, going through every step of the production process. The first step was choosing a circuit that could fit on a board with dimensions of 3"x4". My project was a system that alternated 2 lights between their on and off states when you press a button. The first step was designing the circuit on the computer with a program called Fritzing. Then, I printed out the design and ironed it onto the board with the copper sheet on top. After that, I etched away the excess copper, only leaving the traces required to make a working circuit. I drilled all of the necessary holes, and fitted all of the components onto the board. Finally, I soldered the components and powered the circuit, and the lights flashed back and forth once I pressed the button. The biggest challenge I faced during this process occurred during the soldering phase, where I had to deal with many broken traces that needed to be re-soldered in order to establish the connection once again.
