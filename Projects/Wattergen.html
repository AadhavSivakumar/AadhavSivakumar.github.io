  <p style="margin-bottom:0px">This was my sophomore year entrepreneurship project that i worked on with Tharun Elenchezhean, Sameer Paila, and Darion Phan. Billions of gallons of water go to waste every year through sewage. Simple acts of sanitation, like using the toilet or taking a shower can waste 1-5 gallons of water, fresh water that could be repurposed for a better use. Unfortunately, the technology to completely purify contaminated water is still decades away, so we decided to reuse this water a different way. Sewage is usually transported to the sewage system through pipes, which work with gravity. Sometimes, gravity is overkill for these situations, and the water can still get to the sewage with less force. We decided to create a generator that runs off the excess power provided withing sewage pipes. We did some calculations involving the world's tallest building, the burj khalifa, and figured out by just placing simple dc motor generators in pipes, we can save millions of dollars in electricity per day.
