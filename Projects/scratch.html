    <p style="margin-bottom:0px">This was a 3 week long project that took place in September of 2016. I worked on this project with my partner, Nikolai Param. We decied to make a game using the scratch editor. This game was a 2d zombie shooter game that allowed you to
        choose multiple paths. We encontered many problems in the beginning. Because Scratch was a sprite based language, we had many arguments over what types of sprites we should use. After 2 days, we finally agreed that we should do pixelated
        zombies because they would be the easiest to work with. We started to code all of the sprites but we encountered problems with that too. Even though I had a lot of experience with scratch before, I had never used the backdrops before,
        and we spent a few days doing that. When we implemented the shop into the game (for people to buy upgrades after they take down zombies) wwe had to use ball sorts of broadcasts, which cluttered up the code. We then remade the game
        so that there were less broadcasts which made it less laggy and easier to fix.
