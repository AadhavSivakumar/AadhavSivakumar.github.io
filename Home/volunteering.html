    <p style="margin-bottom:0px">Volunteering is an important part of my life because it's a way I can give back to the community through tangible work. A lot of volunteering comes from boy scouts, but I also try to go out of my way to help others. Over the past few years, I've been going to Tijuana in Mexico to build homes for people who can't afford them. This is through a service called DOXA, which finds people in need and connects them with builders. This opportunity allowed me to see a part of the world that people don't usually have the chance to see, and experience culture in a different way.
