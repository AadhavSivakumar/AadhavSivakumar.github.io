    <p style="margin-bottom:0px">Robotics is one of the most important things that shaped who I am today. I've been doing robotics ever since 4th grade, when I got into FLL and started making robots out of legos to participate in competitions. I did that all the way up until 8th grade, changing who I worked with every year to get a wide range of different personalities and people to work with. After middle school, I got into high school robotics, and I was introduced to a whole new range of ideas, concepts and mechanisms. I've been on gael force robotics for 3 years now, 2 years as a member, and one year as the captain of team 5327B. Throughout these years, I've made it to the world level competition twice, where you get to compete on an international stage. My team won the think award, the trophy for best programming in your division, and went on to advance to division quarterfinals, where onle 0.1% of all teams in the world get to.
