    <p style="margin-bottom:0px">I've been part of boy scout troop 968 ever since I started boy scouts in 6th grade. Boy scouts is one of the things that gave me the values and the morals that I live by today. I'm currently a life scout working toward my eagle scout rank, the highest rank in scouting. During my scouting career, i've spent more than 100 nights camping and learning how to live in the outdoors. I've also done plenty of volunteering through boy scouts, from helping out with food drives that go to local shelters to setting up tents in parks for family events. Boy scouts also taught me useful skills that will stay with me for a lifetime, like first aid and lifesaving. My communication skills greatly imroved from being part of boy scouts due to the nature of what it means to be a boy scout, a loud and assertive member of their community who is always prepared.
